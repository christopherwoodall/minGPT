So if hustvl/yolos-base requires 0.222 TFLOPs and we have a requirement of 120 fps, then we can solve for compute.

GPU FLOPs = 120 × 0.222 = 26.64 TFLOPs or a single 4090


If I'm understanding correctly, we can profile a model - using something like fvcore - to find the operational flops per frame and given a throughput requirement we can estimate the needed compute.

This is really cool. According to this you can calculate expected model throughput(in FPS) given system and model FLOPs.

So FPS = System FLOPs / Calculated Model FLOPs, or in this case:

(1.8 * 10^12) / (2 * 10^10) = 90FPS https://t.co/DqKU8WqeHK
