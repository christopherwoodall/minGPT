So if hustvl/yolos-base requires 0.222 TFLOPs and we have a requirement of 120 fps, then we can solve for compute.

GPU FLOPs = 120 × 0.222 = 26.64 TFLOPs or a single 4090
If I'm understanding correctly, we can profile a model - using something like fvcore - to find the operational flops per frame and given a throughput requirement we can estimate the needed compute.

This is really cool. According to this you can calculate expected model throughput(in FPS) given system and model FLOPs.

So FPS = System FLOPs / Calculated Model FLOPs, or in this case:

(1.8 * 10^12) / (2 * 10^10) = 90FPS https://t.co/DqKU8WqeHK

@michael_timbs @Hasen_Judi Yeah, this is a good example of a hallucination. Grok doesn't "know" about any connections the server may be handling. The 100k number was pulled from latent space. Not really a lie, those characters just have a high probability of following the ones that came before.

@Ken67547214 Interesting. What I grok from all of this is that the current target metric for AI/human text classification seems to be how far out of a "normal" zipf distribution a text falls.

Are there more targeted metrics? Like, prompted with X model Y is more likely to respond with Z.
Word frequency aligns as well, which I assume is an expected result - if you're modeling a language then sematic and lexical artifacts should be preserved. This makes me wonder what the classifier is picking up on.
